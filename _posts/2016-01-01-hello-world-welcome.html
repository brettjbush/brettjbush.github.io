Hello everyone, and welcome to my blog!
</p>
<p>
The more experiences I have in the “real world” of post-undergrad life, the more
 I find myself nerding out over random hobbies. The more I nerd out over random
  hobbies, the more I love to chatter about them. Hence, this blog!
</p>
<p>
So hit up the <a class="mid-post-link" href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tag-search/">#Search</a> tag, find something that interests you and enjoy!
</p>
<p>
…also, if you are curious how I’ve created this blog, I have been using a
  combination of raw HTML/CSS/SASS/JS (great practice) with some help from
  Jekyll with hosting provided by Github.
