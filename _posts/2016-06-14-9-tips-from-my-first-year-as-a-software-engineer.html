<h3>1. Learn Git, love Git</h3>

<p>
...or SVN. No judging, we're all good! Either way, I can nearly guarantee you
will be using some sort of version control system in your semicolon riddled
adventures.
</p>
<p>
Git is one of the most widely used version control systems for code. Learn more
<a class="mid-post-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/">here</a>. It is a handy tool for keeping code organized as a single
developer and absolutely invaluable for collaborating on code with others.
</p>

<p>
For instance, I didn't know Git was a thing until my last semester of college.
How did I do group projects? Get ready: we would send code back and forth via...
ZIP *shudder*.
</p>
<p>
With Git, anyone can collaborate on any code at any time and all the code stays
nice and organized! You'll learn to love it, I promise.
</p>
<h3>2. Tests aren't over after you graduate</h3>
<p>
Scared you! Unit, Regression, and QA Tests, I mean. &#x1F609;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for code to be
"air tight" it should be tested somehow.
</p>
<p>
Testing can get a bad rep. Whether you do it manually or (more recently, and
what I've been working with) automated testing.
</p>
<p>
Just as you are about to slam dunk the coolest new feature into your team's
code repo, you (or a QA specialist) have basically programmed a Shaq robot to
stuff your precious code back in your face with a big red bruise that says
"FAILED".
</p>

<p>
However, testing is actually really cool!
</p>
<p>
It took me a while to realize that a developer, on her or his own, can wear
many hats at once: developer and tester. Not only can you write your own code,
but you can write code to TEST your own code too!?!
</p>
<p>
Feels like your code it coming to life!
</p>
<p>
There are also a ton of <a class="mid-post-link" target="_blank" href="http://www.opensourcetesting.org/">resources</a> out there to help test your
code, so you're not alone. The more you think about testing, the more cool
testing gets, and the more air tight and impressive your code is.
</p>
<p>
<h3>3. My code vs the code</h3>

<p>
This may be more personal opinion, but in my first year I lost something that
had been weighing me down. Two words: "my code". What I got in return? "THE
code". And I will tell you: THE code is WAYYY better then any of my code.
</p>
<p>
Let me explain.
</p>
<p>
There can be an artistry involved with programming. As an artist of the digital
world, there's a natural amount of pride and satisfaction with writing your own
stuff.
</p>
<p>
Feeling ownership over your code is totally natural and fine in itself, but my
advice would be to lighten the reigns, just a little, especially in a team
setting!
</p>
<p>
Why? A couple reasons I've found:
<ul>
<li>You feel more team oriented</li>
<li>You get the job done faster and often better by not reinventing wheels</li>
<li>You stop worrying about yourself being impressive and more the application being
impressive</li>
<li>You become more comfortable with others giving advice, changes, or criticisms
when you are more objective</li>
<li>Most importantly, if something goes wrong you don't have to feel salty since
it's a team effort!</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Now, when referring to code I've written, I take the emphasis off me with a
simple change by calling it "the code" instead of "my code".
</p>
<p>
Don't get me wrong! You can do a lot of incredible things on your own, and you
have all the right in the world to be proud about the accomplishments and apps
you've made, but it's more the mentality of it all, and it's personally worked
for me.
</p>
<p>
Be humble, be a team member, and stand on the shoulders of giants.
</p>
<h3>4. Learn to learn</h3>

<p>
Welcome to the tech industry! Where Moore's Law is always cranking out
something new and better than before!
</p>
<p>
Within my first week I realized that there will always be more to learn, and
that's not bad! In my first year I've been exposed to SO many languages,
frameworks, and tools and am already preparing for more in the coming year.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, there really is a lot you use from from school on a daily basis,
and many of the things you need to learn are either related to or based off any
initial tool set you come pre installed with.
</p>
<p>
It's actually one of the most fun parts of working! There is nothing static or
bland about the day to day since there is always a new thing to learn and apply.
</p>
<h3>5. Quests</h3>

<p>
Quest Unlocked!
</p>
<p>
Or…issue unlocked! And assigned to you! Basically the same thing.
</p>
<p>
In college there was always a syllabus or instructive paper of what to do for a
particular assignment. If you're working on a group project, you'd likely
delegate tasks via word of mouth or on some document.
</p>
<p>
However, when you've got a larger amount of people working on the same product,
it could be difficult to simply tell everyone what to do and avoid confusion.
</p>
<p>
Enter: Issue Tracking Systems
</p>
<p>
Once again, did not know these existed until my first year working, although I
wish I did.
</p>
<p>
Why? Issue tracking systems like <a class="mid-post-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">JIRA</a> and <a class="mid-post-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/features">Github's
  native</a> one give you a measurable and definite goal to complete.
</p>
<p>
They only take a little bit of a learning curve to understand too, which is why
I would totally recommend anyone to start using one sometime before their first
year.
</p>
<p>
If you learn it with a friend too, you two can start making some cool apps in a
organized and collaborative way.
</p>
<p>
Who doesn't like that!?
</p>
<h3>6. Organize your thoughts (and code snippets)</h3>
<p>
Keep a text editor (like Notepad++ or Atom) handy to keep your thoughts and code
 snippets in check.
</p>
<p>
I started one from day one once I realized it's a great tool for keeping
organized and is handy as a temporary workspace, daily log, and dump space for
commands or copies that you don't want to retype.
</p>
<p>
You will never regret having one up in the background.
</p>
<h3>7. The Internet is your friend, especially StackOverflow</h3>
<p>
As I like to joke: I refer to StackOverflow for a living.
</p>
<p>
While that's not entirely true, it is a huge help for day to day things!
</p>
<p>
Keep a search engine handy for everything from forgetting a command or running
into a strange IDE error.
</p>
<p>
As awesome as it would be to know everything about every programming language
and every error, unless you're Paul Bettany's character from the Marvel
Cinematic Universe, that would be a tad difficult.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, software developers and geek types with different areas of
expertise come together on StackOverflow to answer your questions for you.
</p>
<p>
So watch that extra episode of Park and Rec! Someone already solved your bug a
couple years ago on StackOverflow! All you have to do is seek the solution out
online.
</p>

<h3>8. Agile vs Waterfall</h3>

<p>
There are two main workflow methodologies that I was introduced to in my first
year: Agile and Waterfall.
</p>
<p>
Waterfall is basically where development goes in long strides across perhaps
an entire half of a year. For example, the 2.0 release of some app would start
in June and release that December.
</p>
<p>
However, current trends appear to be giving way to a new and more lively
workflow methodology called Agile.
</p>
<p>
Agile is comprised of "sprints", 2-4 week hurdles that require some sort of
demo-able and working prototype of some sort at the end of every sprint. Along
with this, teams stay tight knit and often discuss what they're working on
with each other, so everyone is in the know and working towards the same goal.
</p>
<p>

</p>

<h3>9. Have fun and pursue your passion</h3>
<p>
This goes without saying, but it’s a reality that you can occasionally lose
steam when caught up in the same thing.
</p>
<p>
Stay sharp and learn new things outside of work. This is how innovation and
acceleration in your company and career happens. Incorporate what you love
into your workday and work. Get excited and keep pursuing what you love!
</p>
<p>
All in all, it has been an amazing year of discovery and I'm excited for the
year ahead to learn more.
</p>

<p>
I hope this list has helped anyone about to enter, actually entering, or just
plain interested in the tech industry!

Thanks for reading!
