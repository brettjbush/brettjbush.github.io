It’s easy to get caught up in the rush of the “day-to-day”. Even coffeeshops have added drive thru windows to accommodate the need for quick caffeine!
</p>
<p>
While I sometimes do get my coffee beverages via the drive thru or when I'm on the go, in the past year I’ve made an effort which has helped me have a little more zen and feel a little more classy: ordering the beverage "for here".
</p>
<p>
This is a common custom at more traditional coffee establishments, however for coffee chains like Starbucks and Peets, ordering "for here" can make even the most bustling coffee shop into your own little espresso nook. &#x2615;
</p>
<p>
Here are some benefits:
<ul>
<li>Ensures that you take the time to enjoy your drink</li>
<li>You can sometimes get a 10 cent discount on your drink at Starbucks</li>
<li>Eco friendly since you save some cardboard</li>
<li>You might get a cool design and realize how pretty your drink is (more common at Peets, I've noticed Starbucks can sometimes throw it together just the same)</li>
<li>In my opinion, the drink tastes better with an open top, maybe because you get to smell it as you drink</li>
<li>You look super cool and feel the same</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
So next time you find yourself in a Starbucks or Peets with a couple minutes to spare, simply add "for here" at the end of your order, and they'll grab a classy cup for you, and don't forget to leave a tip! &#x1F609;
