Load your Starbucks Gold Cards, trainers. This Thursday, December 8th the famous coffee chain and the 2016 family game of the year are teaming up. (Source: <a class="mid-post-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/5gqevr/photo_pok%C3%A9mon_go_starbucks_promotion_is_real/">Reddit</a>)

<p>
What does this mean?
</p>
<h3>1. A majority of Starbucks stores will become PokeStops and/or gyms</h3>
<p>
Pokemon Go was undoubtedly the summer hype train of 2016. However with the combination of students returning to school, weather getting colder, and unfortunate lack of updates from Niantic, the game lost a large amount of steam. Now, despite cold weather, trainers can log back in with Pokemon Go's new update still play within the warm confines of their local Starbucks coffeeshop.
</p>
<h3>2. Pokemon Go Frappuccinos</h3>
<p>
Essentially a Vanilla Bean Frapp with raspberry and blackberry syrup, this frappuccino will start going on sale the same date. I don't know if it sounds too good, but hey, it's Pokemon. There will not be any advertising in store, however there will be in the Pokemon Go app itself. If you are a Pokemon fan but don't play, no need to worry, you can apparently still order the Pokeball inspired frozen treat while supplies last.
</p>
<h3>3. Gen 2 Pokemon?</h3>
<p>
This more based on rumor, but many are speculating that Gen 2 Pokemon from Pokemon Gold and Silver will be released into the real world with the upcoming update. Fingers crossed for this as I would love nothing more than to catch a Delibird just in time for Christmas.
</p>
<p>
That's all everyone, happy catching!
