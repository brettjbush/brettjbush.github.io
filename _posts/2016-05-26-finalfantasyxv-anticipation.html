I can still remember it. The first <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BxZzgKzWiw">trailer for Final Fantasy Versus XIII</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Never has one trailer resonated with me at a certain time in my life this one.
</p>
<p>
  Like ever.
</p>
<p>
 I think it was a perfect potion as it hit pretty much every aspect a moody 13
 year old <!--more-->who just finished up Kingdom Hearts 2 could ever ask for.
</p>
{% include mid_post_image.html image="noctis_01.jpg" caption="Look at that emo glory" alt="Noctis looking cool" %}
<!--
<img class="mid-post-image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/noctis_01.jpg" alt="Noctis lookin fly"></img>
<div class="image-caption">Look at that emo glory</div>
-->
<p>
  For instance, the dark yet serene setting of The World that Never Was from Kingdom Hearts 2 was still
 one of the coolest locations in a video game I had ever been put in. Layer that with the fact
 that the one and only Yoko Shimomura (who composed for KH2) ALSO composed the music for FFVXIII. Then to
 top it all off, start the trailer with a moraly challenging quote from none other the WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE!?
</p>
<p>
  Man...just drown me in the sweet, sweet melancholy of teenage angst, SquareEnix.
